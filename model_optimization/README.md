# ML Model Development Pipeline  
## **Model Optimization**

Welcome to the model_optimization folder in your ML pipeline.

## **Purpose**: This folder is for optimizing the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its predictive performance.

## **How to Use**:
1. **Import and Run the Script**: Open the 'model_optimization.py' script using a Python interpreter. 



```python
 python model_optimization.py.
 ```



2. **Model Optimization**: This will optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model.

## **Contents**  
- **'model_optimization.py'**: The main Python script for model optimization. This script will:
    - Import the trained model from the model_training step.
    - Perform hyperparameter optimization using techniques like grid search or random search.
    - Retrain the model with the optimized hyperparameters.
    - Save the optimized model.
- **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the model optimization process and the optimized hyperparameters.
