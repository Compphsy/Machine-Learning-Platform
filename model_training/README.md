# ML Model Development Pipeline
## **Model Training**

Welcome to the model_training folder in your ML pipeline.

## **Purpose**: This folder is where the selected model will be trained on the preprocessed and feature-engineered data.


## **How to Use**:
1. **Import and Run the Script**: Open the 'model_training.py' script using a Python interpreter. 
  


```python
 python model_training.py
 ```



2. **Model Training**: This will train the selected model on the prepared dataset.

## **Contents**  
- **'model_training.py'**: The main Python script for model training. This script will:
    - Import the preprocessed and feature-engineered data.
    - Train the selected model on the training data.
    - Perform any hyperparameter tuning (if needed).
    - Save the trained model to be used in the deployment step.
- **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the model training process.
