# My ML Platform

**Introduction:**
This platform is designed to train machine learning models on battery charging data with the aim of predicting the lifetime of the battery. Each step of the machine learning process is customizable and compartmentalized into its own folder. Below is the suggested sequence of steps:  
 

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 
 Then, activate the **`main.py`** script located in the root folder to initiate the ML pipeline: 
    

```Bash
python main.py
```

### After the environment is set up you will  follow these steps as part of the machine learning pipeline. 

1. **Data Collection** (`data_collection/`): Gather data related to battery charging.
2. **Data Preprocessing** (`data_preprocessing/`): Clean the data and handle missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering** (`feature_engineering/`): Identify or create features that could be predictive of battery life.
4. **Model Selection** (`model_selection/`): Choose a machine learning model that's suitable for your problem.
5. **Model Training** (`model_training/`): Train your model on your preprocessed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation** (`model_evaluation/`): Assess the performance of your model using appropriate metrics.
7. **Model Optimization** (`model_optimization/`): Tune your model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
8. **Deployment** (`deployment/`): Deploy your model to your platform.

Please refer to the `README.md` file in each folder for more details about each step.
