# ML Model Development Pipeline  
## **Deployment**

Welcome to the deployment folder in your ML pipeline. 

## **Purpose**: This folder prepares the trained model for real-world prediction and deployment. It involves packaging the model with its dependencies and setting up a prediction endpoint.


## **How to Use**:
1. **Import the Required Modules**: Ensure you have imported the necessary libraries like 'flask' for creating the web application.
2. **Update the 'deployment.py' Script**: Modify the script to include your trained model and any additional preprocessing steps required for making predictions.
3. **Run the Deployment Script**: Run the 'deployment.py' script to start the local prediction server.


```Python
python deployment.py
```



Note: Depending on your deployment environment, you might need additional steps, such as setting up a cloud platform or containerization.

## **Contents**
- **'deployment.py'**: The main Python script for deploying the model. This script will:
    - Load the trained model.
    - Define a prediction endpoint that accepts user input and returns predictions.
    - Implement any required preprocessing for the input data.
    - Optionally, you can set up a Flask application for local deployment.
- **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the model deployment process and instructions for local deployment.
