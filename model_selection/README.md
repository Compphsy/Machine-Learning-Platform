# ML Model Development Pipeline  
## **Model Selection**

Welcome to the model_selection folder in your ML model development pipeline. 

## **Purpose**: This folder is responsible for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate machine learning model for your specific problem. Different models will be trained on the preprocessed data and then compared to determine the best performing one.

## **How to Use**:
1. **Import and Run the Script**: Open the 'model_selection.py' script using a Python interpreter. 
   


```python
   python model_selection.py
   ```



2. **Model Evaluation**: The script will train and evaluate different models. Explore the different model architectures and evaluation metrics used here.


## **Contents**
- **'model_selection.py'**: The main Python script for model selection. This script will:
    - Import preprocessed data and trained models from previous steps.
    - Perform model selection using techniques like:
        - K-fold cross-validation
        - Grid search
        - Randomized search
    - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, R-squared).
    - Select the best-performing model and save it.
- **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the model selection process and the chosen model.
