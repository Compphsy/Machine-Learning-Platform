# ML Model Development Pipeline 
## **Data Preprocessing**

Welcome to the data_preprocessing folder in your ML model development pipeline. 

## **Purpose**: This folder is responsible for cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing the raw data that was collected in the previous step. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis, feature engineering, and model training. 

## **How to Use** :
1. **Source the Data**: The raw data should be in a format suitable for preprocessing, which typically is in a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Import and Run the Script**: Open the 'data_preprocessing.py' script using a Python interpreter and ensure that the required dependencies are installed.



```python
 python data_preprocessing.py
```



This will execute the data preprocessing script. 

3. **Explore the Preprocessed Data**: The script should save the preprocessed data to a file (e.g., a CSV or '*.pkl' file). Run the script to inspect the preprocessed data and ensure it looks clean and ready for the next steps.

## **Contents**
- **'data_preprocessing.py'**: The main Python script for data preprocessing. This script should:
    - Import the raw data.
    - Perform necessary cleaning and transformation steps.
    - Handle missing values (if applicable).
    - Perform any required data scaling or normalization.
    - Save the preprocessed data to a suitable format.
- **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the data preprocessing module.
