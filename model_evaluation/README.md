# ML Model Development Pipeline  
## **Model Evaluation**

Welcome to the model_evaluation folder in your ML pipeline.

## **Purpose**: This folder is where the trained model's performance will be assessed on a separate test dataset.

## **How to Use**:
1. **Import and Run the Script**: Open the 'model_evaluation.py' script using a Python interpreter. 



```python
 python model_evaluation.py
 ```



2. **Model Evaluation**: This will evaluate the performance of the optimized model.


## **Contents**
- **'model_evaluation.py'**: The main Python script for model evaluation. This script will:
    - Import the optimized model from the model_optimization step.
    - Load the test data and evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
    - Use appropriate evaluation metrics and generate detailed reports.
- **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the model evaluation process, including metrics and visualizations.
